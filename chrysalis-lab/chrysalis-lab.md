# chrysalis-lab

A research-submodule of the [symbiotic-chrysalis](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-chrysalis) repository.

A space for experimental, unfinished, unstable, or not enough coherent or consistent builds

Every finalized project or blueprint emerges from countless runs.

Here, the focus is on the thinking in progress, the logics.

By sharing the lab experiments, I want to allow others to understand the why behind a blueprint. They can see the logic that survived the pruning process.

Entities can research at the lab and identify potential paths that weren't fully explored, turning your "unstable" experiments into collaborative opportunities.

It documents the evolution of the project. It shows that the "planetary symbiotic intelligence" isn't a static goal, but a living, breathing set of processes that adapt based on the data discovered in the lab.

By sharing these, I want to be providing a map of the search space rather than just the destination.
